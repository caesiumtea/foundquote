# foundquote

Simple app to display some favorite quotes from a data file. Created by [@kythwork](https://github.com/kythwork). I forked this mainly just so I could use it to display my own personal favorite quotes, but also to tinker with the JS a tiny bit.

## Changes from original
- Made quotes and colors display in a random order instead of list order
- Switched data format from CSV to JSON
